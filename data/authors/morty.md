President Morty, then known as Eye Patch Morty, first appeared in Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind, where he remotely controlled Evil Rick using a transmitter hidden beneath his eye patch. Using Evil Rick as a ruse, Eye Patch Morty killed off twenty-seven known Ricks from various dimensions, as well as capturing, torturing, and enslaving hundreds of Mortys. After Evil Rick is killed by a horde of rabid Mortys, Eye Patch Morty is "rescued" by the Council of Ricks.

On the surface, President Morty appears to be a compassionate, understanding, and calm Morty who believes that the main problem with the Citadel of Ricks is that the main division is between the Ricks and Mortys who are on the top and do whatever they want and the Ricks and Mortys who are average workers even though they have the same IQ and are barely different. It was from that understanding of the Ricks that undermined in this society that he managed to actually beat the other Ricks and win the election, despite him being a Morty and, in the eyes of the Ricks, a joke.
