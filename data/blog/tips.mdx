## Typography Tips & Tricks

- Add lead paragraph to your mdx toolbelt.
- We remove all default styling - we need to create good basis for typography.
- They use prose class as module that wraps content. Should we do the same?

## Structure

- make list when you have at least three elements
- Typography should be easy
- Using nested list - **not a good idea.**
- Navigation & Lists should be as flat as possible (UX?).
- In markdown `<li>` elements don't have `<p>` tags when you use just one paragraph.
- They add `<p>` tags when you use multiple paragraphs in your `<li>`.
- The fact that you have tags from: `<h1>-<h6>`, doesn't mean you should use them all.
  Your headings levels should be: 2-3 levels deep.

## Edge Cases

1. Stacking headings
2. Heading comes after a paragraph
3. Headings can be closer together
4. We need more space to separate headings from paragraphs though.
5. More complex list examples (list Items with headings)
6. It's cool when list items have headings :D
7. In this situation we need spacing - list item heading, and separate items.
8. Using code inside headings
9. Code inside a link

10. Your examples and dummy content should be realistic (maybe we should try to avoid using lorem ipsum?)
11. Don't finish your blog post sections with lists. Add at least one sentence of comment before you jump to next section.
12. We should improve coloring of our code blocks. Things to consider:

Lift($L$) can be determined by Lift Coefficient ($C_L$) like the following equation.

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L
$$
